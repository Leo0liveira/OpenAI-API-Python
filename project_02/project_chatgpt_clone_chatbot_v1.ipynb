      "There isn’t a one-size-fits-all list, but these nutrient-dense foods are great to include daily:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Vegetables: aim for variety (spinach/kale, broccoli, peppers, carrots)\n",
      "- Fruits: berries, citrus, apples (1–2 servings)\n",
      "- Whole grains: oats, quinoa, brown rice, barley\n",
      "- Protein: beans/lentils, eggs, fish (fatty fish like salmon 2x/week), chicken, tofu/tempeh\n",
      "- Nuts and seeds: almonds, walnuts, chia, flax (a small handful)\n",
      "- Dairy or fortified alternatives: yogurt/kefir, cheese, fortified plant milks\n",
      "- Healthy fats: olive oil, avocado\n",
      "- Fermented foods (optional daily): yogurt/kefir, sauerkraut, kimchi\n",
      "- Hydration: water (limit sugary drinks)\n",
      "\n",
      "Quick daily plan (example):\n",
      "- Breakfast: oats with berries and yogurt\n",
      "- Lunch: big salad with greens, chickpeas, olive oil + lemon\n",
      "- Snack: apple with a handful of nuts\n",
      "- Dinner: grilled salmon or lentil curry with quinoa and vegetables\n",
      "\n",
      "Tips:\n",
      "- Fill half your plate with vegetables, a quarter with lean/protein and/or plant-based protein, a quarter with whole grains.\n",
      "- Limit added sugars, refined grains, and highly processed foods.\n",
      "- If you have allergies or medical conditions, adjust accordingly or consult a nutritionist (and vegans may need fortified foods for B12, D, iron, etc.).\n",

      "\n",
      "Servings: 4\n",
      "Total time: about 40 minutes\n",
      "\n",
      "Ingredients\n",
      "- 1 cup dry quinoa, rinsed\n",
      "- 2 cups water or broth\n",
      "- 4 salmon fillets (about 6 oz each) or 2 cups cooked chickpeas (vegan option)\n",
      "- 2 cups broccoli florets\n",
      "- 1 large red bell pepper, sliced\n",
      "- 1 cup cherry tomatoes (optional)\n",
      "- 3–4 tbsp olive oil, divided\n",
      "- Salt and pepper to taste\n",
      "- 1 tsp paprika (or more, to taste)\n",
      "- 1/2 tsp garlic powder\n",
      "- 1 lemon (zest and juice)\n",
      "- 1 avocado, sliced\n",
      "- 1/4 cup almonds or walnuts, chopped\n",
      "- 1/2 cup plain yogurt (Greek yogurt works) + 2 tbsp tahini (optional)\n",
      "- 1 clove garlic, minced\n",
      "- Fresh parsley or dill, chopped (optional)\n",
      "- Optional: feta cheese, crumbled\n",
      "\n",
      "Dressing (yogurt-tahini)\n",
      "- 1 cup yogurt\n",
      "- 2 tbsp tahini (optional)\n",
      "- 1–2 tbsp lemon juice\n",
      "- 1 clove garlic, minced\n",
      "- Salt to taste\n",
      "- Water to reach pourable consistency\n",
      "\n",
      "Instructions\n",
      "1) Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Rinse quinoa; simmer in 2 cups water/broth until fluffy (about 15 minutes). Keep warm.\n",
      "2) Toss broccoli and bell pepper with 1–2 tbsp olive oil, salt, pepper, paprika, and garlic powder. If using chickpeas, toss them with a pinch of salt and olive oil.\n",
      "3) Season salmon with salt, pepper, and a little paprika. Place salmon on a lined baking sheet. Roast salmon 12–15 minutes, until done. On a second sheet (or same sheet if space allows), roast veggies 12–15 minutes, until tender.\n",
      "4) Make dressing: whisk yogurt, tahini (if using), lemon juice, garlic, and a pinch of salt. Thin with a splash of water to desired consistency.\n",
      "5) Assemble bowls: spoon quinoa as base, top with roasted veggies, salmon (or chickpeas), avocado slices, and nuts. Drizzle with yogurt dressing. Garnish with lemon zest and herbs; sprinkle feta if desired.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tips and substitutions\n",
      "- For vegan: skip salmon; use extra chickpeas or roasted tempeh, and use dairy-free yogurt.\n",
      "- Add a citrusy finish with extra lemon juice at the table.\n",
      "- If you’re short on time, cook quinoa in advance and reheat; roast veggies and salmon overlap can reduce total time.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Rough estimates for 1 serving (the recipe makes 4 servings). Exact values vary by brand and exact amounts you use.\n",
      "\n",
      "- With salmon and tahini in dressing: about 800 kcal per serving.\n",
      "- With salmon but no tahini: about 750 kcal per serving.\n",
      "- Vegan (chickpeas instead of salmon) with tahini: about 560 kcal per serving.\n",
      "- Vegan with chickpeas, no tahini: about 520 kcal per serving.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bottom line: roughly 520–800 kcal per serving depending on protein and dressing choice. If you share the exact amounts you plan to use, I can recalc precisely.\n"
